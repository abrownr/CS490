#information I need to pass to you guys:
    #grade[1] contains their numberic grade, needed no matter what.
    #new_output[0] is FEEDBACK for the first part of the question.
    #new_output[1] is FEEDBACK for the second part of the question.
    #new_output[2] is OVERALL FEEDBACK for the question, simply stating their grade, in sentence form.
    #java_output outputs all new_output as one long string, which I separated into the separate parts. easier to work with.
    
    #if the above code never reaches compilation, none of these values are created, and should not be passed. In that case...
    #error_output explains that a compilation error was encountered, and 0 points will be awarded.
    #grade[1] will be then changed to reflect the compilation error, with 0 points for the question.
    
#still need to do:
    #receive input from the student taking the test. save it into first variable, $output
    #send relevant data to database for any necessary computations, saving, etc.
    #utilzing a try/catch block to test it, capturing any exceptions and flagging them. however, I can't think of any exceptions
        #that would be caught in order to test it. right now you basically get 100 or it doesn't compile. I can't think of
            #an example where it will compile but not give the right answer.
